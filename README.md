# HomeCare
Submission for W5's 3-day Case Comp + Hackathon (Placed 2nd!)

We were tasked with identifying a prevalent social problem today and developing a solution to such an issue. Our team chose to focus on the issue of the struggles seniors had to go due to covid restrictions keeping them at home. Specifically, seniors weren't able to get much help from nurses being isolated at home. This forced them to take care of themselves, which can be a struggle for those who are dependent on nurses. 

Our team's solution was HomeCare, a simple yet informative and interactive dashboard for seniors for all their health needs! Our app featured an Updates Panel for new information the user should know, a Chat Panel for asynchronous communication with the associated Nurse, a Calender for quick overview of upcoming events/appointments, A password-protected Reports section, an Entertainment section with a collection of articles, as well as an automated 'Urgent Booking' feature. Our design wasn't perfect, but it was a viable MVP our team was proud of!
